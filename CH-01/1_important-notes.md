## What is Java?
- General-Purpose
- Object-oriented
- Platform independent
- Concurrent programming language
- Runs very fast

### General purpose:
Not constrained to one particular domain and can be used to develop wide variety of applications

### Object-oriented:
Helps model real world scenarios in a more natural way

### Platform independent:
Follows "Write Once Run Anywhere" i.e write a program once and can run on any platform regardless of operating-system and machine architecture

### Concurrent:
Supports Multi-threading, enabling programs to perform multiple activities at the same time.

### Very Fast:
Almost indistinguishable from C & C++

### Familiar Syntax:
Syntax is similar to C & C++

### Simple & Safe:
Simple to use compared to C & C++
> Eg: Memory management in C & C++ is done manually by developers which can lead to programs getting crashed if not done properly. In contrast, Java provides automatic memory management using Garbage collection making it easy to use.

Programs can be downloaded from across the network & does not produce any harm.

### Rich library:
Comes with rich libraries which include some predefined functionality called the Java API, which helps programmers to implement new logic without having to reinvent the way.

### Open-source & Free:
Helps to develop and launch a program without having to invest a lot in the software

### Variety:
Can be used to develop large scale application starting from embedded device to web-browser applications called applets, standalone applications and mobile applications.


## History:
- Sun mircosystems acquired by oracle in 2010
- Sun mircosystems in 1991 started a "Green project", to create a network of heterogeneous consumer devices which are small, reliable,  distributed and real-time embedded systems.
- Since embedded systems were under consideration, the requirement was that the program should consume less memory.
- The devices should be able to communicate with each other and pass around the software programs.
- Since sharing of programs was allowed, the program should run on the target device without any issue giving rise to platform-independence.
- Also there should be no harm to target devices on sharing the programs.
- The device should be able to perform multiple activities at the same time. For instance, if the current device is downloading some component from another device it should be able to perform another task while the program is getting downloaded.

- C++ was rejected since it did not meet the requirements, Platform independence being one of them
- James Gosling created an entire new language and named it as "OAK", later changes to "JAVA".

- The final product by Green Team was called " *7 "
- Java met WWW where in Linux servers can communicate with windows clients and vice versa.
- Earlier Internet involved only moving static content, so by  integrating java the pages can be made more interactive and dynamic. So "HotJava" browser was developed which allowed Applets(java programs) to be embedded in HTML pages
